Lisp In Small Parts
===================

LISP (Lisp In Small Parts) (really good name) is a small tutorial to learn Common Lisp easily made by David Johnson-Davies.
You can find it [here](http://lisp.plasticki.com/show?36).

If you wish to learn Common Lisp, first start with [Lisp In Small Parts](http://lisp.plasticki.com/show?36), then take [L(Î»)THW - Learn Lisp The Hard Way](http://learnlispthehardway.org/) and if you haven't got enough go for a book called [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) (Although I don't like the way it has been structured, it has some good examples).

You should install a Common Lisp compiler to try things out in the REPL, [SBCL(Steel Bank Common Lisp)](http://www.sbcl.org/) will help you with that.

Just `sudo apt-get install sbcl` it, or get the Windows installer.

Happy learning.
