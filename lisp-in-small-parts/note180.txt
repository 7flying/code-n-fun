Notes on 1.8
------------

Testing if:		

				-two objects are identical: eq
					(eq 'fred 'fred)
				-numbers: =, >, <
				-a nuber is even or odd: evenp, oddp
					(evenp 2) --> T
				-two strings are equal: string=
					(string= "Hello" "Hello")
				-is something a  -number: numberp
								 -list: listp
				-something is nil: null

Conditional tests:

					-if: only alows to give one paramenter to be executed at the if and another in the else.
					(if (evenp a)
						(print "Answer is even")
						(print "Answer is odd")) ; else

					(defun maximum (a b)
						(if (> a b)
							a
							b))

Grouping procedures:
						
						-progn: to wrap several procedures in a single bracketed list
						(if (even a)
							(progn (print "Answer is even") 0)
							(progn (print "Answer is odd") 1))
