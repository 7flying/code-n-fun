[CH2] Lather, Rinse, Repeat: A Tour of the REPL
===============================================
; 16/07/14

(format t "string") -> t: sends output to standard output
					-> it returns NIL: Lisp's version of false/null

* DEFUN :
(defun hello-world ()
	(format t "Hello, world"))

==================================

Types of operators: functions, macros and special operators.

List example:
	(list 1 2 3)
Property list example (plist):
	(list :a 1 :b 2 c:3)	-> keyword: any name that starts with ':', :a, :b, :c

* GETF function: Takes a plist and a symbol and returns the value in the plist following the symbol.
	(getf (list :a 1 :b 2 c:3) :a) -> returns 1

; 17/07/14

(format t "岷卑酤狺%" cd)

* FORMAT: takes two arguments, (1) the stream where it sends the output (t is the shorthand for *standard-output*) and (2) a format string that can contain text and directives.
	Format directives start with  (analogous to % in C)
	FORMAT DIRECTIVES:	
		a: aesthetic: consume one argument and output it in a human-readable form.
			example: 	(format t "a" "Dixie Chicks")
					 	-> returns: Dixie Chicks
					 	   			NIL
						(format t "a" :title)
						-> returns: TITLE
									NIL
		t: tabulating. 10t tells FORMAT to move to the tenth column before processing the text a. It doesn't consume any arguments.
			example: 	(format t "a:10ta" :artist "Dixie Chicks")
						-> returns: ARTIST:        Dixie Chicks
									NIL
		翳铄狎珲礤铘麸忮泔铙蹴邃眭篝忮扉篝葡彝猎祜镳秭弪翳扉篝痱镢弩箝铉翳溟蝈泗轹弩躅糸
		}: means end of list.
		%: doesn't consume any arguments, tells to emit a newline

Example:

(defun prompt-read (prompt) ; Returns string
	(format *query-io* "a: " prompt)
	(force-output *query-io*)
	(read-line *query-io*))

* PARSE-INTEGER: parses an integer out of the string received as an input. Returns an error if something goes wrong.
	example:	(parse-integer (prompt-read "Rating")) -> expects a number

	If given the argument :junk-allowed is not that strict.
	example:	(parse-integer (prompt-read "Rating") :junk-allowed t)

	But if no integer is found it will return NIL rather than number, so that should be 0 in our case so if we make:
	(or (parse-integer (prompt-read "Rating") :junk-allowed t) 0)
	the default value becomes 0

* Y-OR-N-P: it reprompts the user if he enters something but y/Y/n/N

;  6/08/14

Example:

(defun save-db (filename)
	(with-open-file (out filename
						:direction :output
						:if-exists :supersede)
		(with-standard-io-syntax
			(print *db* out))))

* WITH-OPEN_FILE: opens a file, binds the stream to a variable, executes a set of expressions and then closes the file.
	- :direction :output -> for writing
	- :if-exists :supersede -> overwrite if file already exists

* PRINT: prints Lisp objects in a form that can be read back by the Lisp reader

* WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX: ensures that certain variables have 'standard' values

Example:

(defun load-db (filename)
	(with-open-file (in filename)
		(with-standard-io-syntax
			(setf *db* (read in)))))

This time the default of :input is used and so :directions is no longer needed.

* READ: reads from the stream, in this case 'in'.

* SETF: it is Common Lisp's main assignment operator. Set's its first argument to the result of evaluating its second argument.
