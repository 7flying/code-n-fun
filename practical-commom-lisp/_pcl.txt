[CH2] Lather, Rinse, Repeat: A Tour of the REPL
===============================================
; 16/07/14

(format t "string") -> t: sends output to standard output
					-> it returns NIL: Lisp's version of false/null

* DEFUN :
(defun hello-world ()
	(format t "Hello, world"))


[CH3] Practical: A Simple Database
==================================

Types of operators: functions, macros and special operators.

List example:
	(list 1 2 3)
Property list example (plist):
	(list :a 1 :b 2 c:3)	-> keyword: any name that starts with ':', :a, :b, :c

* GETF function: Takes a plist and a symbol and returns the value in the plist following the symbol.
	(getf (list :a 1 :b 2 c:3) :a) -> returns 1

; 17/07/14

(format t "~{~a:~10t~a~%~}~%" cd)

* FORMAT: takes two arguments, (1) the stream where it sends the output (t is the shorthand for *standard-output*) and (2) a format string that can contain text and directives.
	Format directives start with ~ (analogous to % in C)
	FORMAT DIRECTIVES:	
		~a: aesthetic: consume one argument and output it in a human-readable form.
			example: 	(format t "~a" "Dixie Chicks")
					 	-> returns: Dixie Chicks
					 	   			NIL
						(format t "~a" :title)
						-> returns: TITLE
									NIL
		~t: tabulating. ~10t tells FORMAT to move to the tenth column before processing the text ~a. It doesn't consume any arguments.
			example: 	(format t "~a:~10t~a" :artist "Dixie Chicks")
						-> returns: ARTIST:        Dixie Chicks
									NIL
		~{: the next argument to be consumed must be a list. FORMAT loops over the list processing the directives until ~}
		~}: means end of list.
		~%: doesn't consume any arguments, tells to emit a newline
