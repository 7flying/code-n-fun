# Controlling Execution Flow

The instruction pointer ```EIP``` determines which instruction is going to be
executed next. We cannot modify directly the instruction pointer; however, there
are some instructions that can alter it in some specific conditions.

You can use instructions that modify the ```EIP``` register unconditionally
(*unconditional branches*) or based on a condition (*conditional branches*).

## Unconditional branches

There are three types of unconditional branches: *jumps*, *calls* and
*interrupts*.

* *Jumps* are used to go to a specific memory address declared as a label, such
  as ```loop:```, ```end:``` etc; when the processor encounters a jump the
  instruction pointer is changed to the address specified by the jump.

* *Calls* are similar to jump instructions but they remember where they jumped
  from and can return there. Calls are used to implement functions.

* *Interrupts* are used to signal events happening at the hardware level. When
  an interrupt is made the control of the processor is transferred to another
  program.


#### *Jumps*

The instuction format is as follows:

```GAS
jmp location
```

Where ```location``` is a value declared as a label within the program.

Internally the ```jmp``` instruction is translated to three different opcodes
depending on the distance (number of bytes jumped) from the ```jmp```
instruction memory location, and the destination memory location.

The types are divided into:

* Short jumps: when the jump is less than 128 bytes far.

* Far jumps: in segmented memory models, when the jump has a destination
  in another segment.

* Near jumps: when the jump is more than 128 bytes far, and in the same segment.


For instance, see ```jmptest.s```:

```GAS
	# jmptest.s - An example of the jmp instruction
	.section .text
	.globl _start
_start:
	nop
	# set 1 for exit syscall
	movl $1, %eax
	jmp downthere
	# set 10 as a result code
	movl $10, %ebx
	int $0x80
downthere:
	# set 20 as a result code
	movl $20, %ebx
	int $0x80
```

After running it, we can check that it went through the ```downthere``` branch
by checking the result code:

```bash
echo $?
```

And it will give us ```20```, as expected.

If we disassemble the code we can see that ```400087 <downthere>``` is assigned
as the jump destination:

```
jmptest:     file format elf64-x86-64

Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000400078 <_start>:
  400078:	90                   	nop
  400079:	b8 01 00 00 00       	mov    $0x1,%eax
  40007e:	eb 07                	jmp    400087 <downthere>
  400080:	bb 0a 00 00 00       	mov    $0xa,%ebx
  400085:	cd 80                	int    $0x80

0000000000400087 <downthere>:
  400087:	bb 14 00 00 00       	mov    $0x14,%ebx
  40008c:	cd 80                	int    $0x80

```


#### *Calls*


#### *Interrupts*

There are two types: *software* and *hardware* interrupts.

* Hardware interrupts: are generated by hardware devices (these devices
  are outside the processor, such as a hard disk). You can see the hardware
  interrupts received by a Linux system on ```/proc/interrupts```.

* Software interrupts: are generated by programs and are provided by the
  operating system, they can be generated using the ```INT``` instruction.

  The format is: ```INT code```.
  
  These interrupts provide functions within the operating system and the BIOS.
  You have to specify a code with the ```INT``` instruction;
  Microsoft DOS used ```0x21``` as the software interrupt, ```0x10``` and
  ```0x16``` are for the BIOS interrupt call, and Linux uses ```0x80```.


When a program is called via interrupt, the caller is put on hold and the called
program takes the control. The instruction pointer is transferred to the called
program, which continues the execution until it completes, then the control
returns to the caller program using an interrupt return instruction (```IRET```
 or ```IRETD```).
