=====================

Syntax Overview in 5 minutes
----------------------------

Atom: number, symbol, character literals, strings, empty list

	nil = '() -> nil is defined as the empty list

List: '() , '(this is a list)

	'... = (quote ...)

Hello world!: (princ "Hello world, from Lisp!")

Lisp in More Detail
--------------------

REPL: Read-Eval-Print-Loop

Expresion: 	always returns something -even itself
			two kinds: atoms and lists
				-atom: singular thing
				-list: enclosed in a pair of parentheses, list of expresions (atoms or lists)
					   Unless marked as data, lists are treated as a function.

Lists: 	stored as chains of pointer-pairs named CONS-CELLS. Cell points either to a memory address where a value is 			stored or to another cons-cell.
			-First cell in cons-cell:  car -> Contents Address Register		(first of a list)
			-Second cell in cons-cell: cdr  -> Contents Decrement Register	(rest of a list)
		
		pointer-pair = cons-cells

'my-adition-function
'my-integer-type
'my-hash-table
'my-list-of-alists

;; Global variables declared as top-level forms with defvar or defparameter
'*my-global-variable* ; This are called earmuffs

;;;; four preceding semi-colons for file headers, copyright and license information

;;; three preceding semi-colons for descriptive text

;; two preceding semi-colons for commentary on the immediately following text

; one preceding semi-colon for in-line comments, inside code blocks
