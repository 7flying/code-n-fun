Code'n'Fun
==========

What came first, fun or code?

This is a collection of little things made by reading books/tutorials in order
to learn by example.

#### Index

* OS stuff:
    + [kernel-module](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/kernel-module):
      Learned how to make Linux Kernel modules, I'm going to need this
      at [Sysdaga](https://github.com/7flying/sysdaga) and in an upcoming project.
    + [little-os](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/little-os):
      Learning the ins and outs of OS design and development (in progress).
* Low level stuff:
    + [custom-ptrace](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/custom-ptrace):
      Just needed to understand how ptrace works because I'm using it a lot
      in [Sysdaga](https://github.com/7flying/sysdaga).
    + [prass (Practical Assembly)](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/prass):
      Learning Assembly (in progress).
* Common Lisp Stuff: My AI professor spoke highly of Lisp and I didn't know
  much about functional programming (just SQL) so I decided to learn this
  interesting language.
	+ [lisp-in-small-parts](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/lisp-in-small-parts):
	  Best tutorial found so far.
    + [llthw](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/llthw)
	  (Learn Lisp The Hard Way): Currently it is being written, can't wait to
	  see it finished. 
	+ [practical-common-lisp](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/practical-commom-lisp):
      I hold opposite views of this book, so judge it by yourself.
* Functional programming stuff: because lambda is the true way.
    + [brave-clojure](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/brave-clojure):
      Learning Clojure (in progress)
* Web stuff:
    + [flask-microblog](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/flask-microblog):
      After playing with Django I wanted to have more flexibility + simplicity,
      so I decided to give Flask a go. Later I used Flask at the server
      of [Yil-Pil](https://github.com/7flying/yil-pil).
    + [rest-knockout](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/rest-knockout):
      Simple tutorial about Knockout, later I used Knockout for the frontend
      of [Yil-Pil](https://github.com/7flying/yil-pil).
* General programming language stuff:
    + [rusty-rust](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/rusty-rust):
      Improve my rusty Rust (in progress).
* Else: 
    + [collective-intelligence](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/collective-intelligence):
      Book by the name of 'Programming Collective Intelligence' (in progress).
    + [think-complexity](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/think-complexity):
      A book about complexity science (in progress).
