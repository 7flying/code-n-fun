Code'n'Fun
==========

What came first, fun or code?

This is a collection of little things made by reading books/tutorials in order to learn by example.

#### Index

* [custom-ptrace](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/custom-ptrace): Just needed to understand how ptrace works because I'm using it a lot in [Sysdaga](https://github.com/7flying/sysdaga).
* [flask-microblog](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/flask-microblog): After playing with Django I wanted to have more flexibility + simplicity, so I decided to give Flask a go. Later I used Flask at the server of [Yil-Pil](https://github.com/7flying/yil-pil).
* [kernel-module](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/kernel-module): Learned how to make Linux Kernel modules, I'm going to need this at [Sysdaga](https://github.com/7flying/sysdaga) and in an upcoming project.
* Common Lisp Stuff: My AI professor spoke highly of Lisp and I didn't know much about functional programming (just SQL) so I decided to learn this interesting language.
  * [lisp-in-small-parts](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/lisp-in-small-parts): Best tutorial found so far.
  * [llthw](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/llthw) (Learn Lisp The Hard Way): Currently it is being written, can't wait to see it finished. 
  * [practical-common-lisp](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/practical-commom-lisp): I hold opposite views of this book, so judge it by yourself.
* [rest-knockout](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/rest-knockout): Simple tutorial about Knockout, later I used Knockout for the frontend of [Yil-Pil](https://github.com/7flying/yil-pil). 
* [brave-clojure](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/brave-clojure): Learning Clojure
* [collective-intelligence](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/collective-intelligence): Book by the name 'Programming Collective Intelligence'
* [think-complexity](https://github.com/7flying/code-n-fun/tree/master/think-complexity): A book about complexity science
